# Introduction

Welcome to the web page made for listing all of the actions provided with the Botymuch streamer bot built and maintained by [Berymuch](https://www.twitch.tv/berymuch). While the majority of these commands were created by me, I have included those made by others that I have found to be useful.

> [!NOTE]
> Many of the actions in this bot are in active development and also update irregularly. Check back infrequently for more details as I record them.
