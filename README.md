# Streamer.Bot
Streamer.Bot Actions: https://streamer.bot/

This is a collection of ~180+ actions I've created to support my Twitch channel! It automates various components that I had previously relied on webserver-based bots for, and does so while running entirely locally from your computer. To install the actions, download the latest version and import it into streamer bot by dragging and dropping the text file into the import window. 

Additional files can be found in the action texts folder that support some of the functions present in the rest of the actions. Note that some rely on specific scenes/filters/sources to be present in OBS to function- these aspects of this bot will not work out of the box.

All credit for the stremer bot application goes to its developers.

There is a TON here to document and I haven't done any of it hahaha- stay tuned!
