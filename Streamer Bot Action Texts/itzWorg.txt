A worg prowls the treeline, eyes gleaming with cold intelligence.
The forest goes still as its heavy paws press into the soil.
You hear the low rumble of a growl before you see it.
A mix of wolf and something far older watches from the dark.
Steam rises from its muzzle, breath hot in the night air.
The worg’s fangs flash as it grins, half challenge, half hunger.
It moves with the ease of a predator that knows it cannot be caught.
The ground bears the marks of claws that don’t dull with age.
A deep snarl cuts through the wind, warning and promise alike.
Its eyes gleam red for an instant, then vanish into the black.
The worg circles slowly, measuring you with patient malice.
You catch the scent of blood and pine, old and fresh.
A low chuckle rumbles from its throat—mocking, amused.
The beast’s fur bristles, charged with primal energy.
It steps into the light, muscles coiled beneath thick fur.
The worg’s ears twitch, catching every whisper of sound.
You feel watched, weighed, and found wanting.
A trail of pawprints smokes faintly in the frost.
The worg’s voice comes out rough, almost human.
Its tail sways lazily, betraying predatory confidence.
A howl splits the night, long and commanding.
The air seems to bend around its presence.
The worg sits back, amused by your stillness.
It sniffs the wind, scenting fear like perfume.
The creature’s gaze pierces straight through your calm.
Its laughter sounds like gravel sliding down stone.
A single bite mark in the dirt shows where it’s been.
The worg’s breath brushes your ear—close, too close.
It fades into the night, leaving only silence and tracks.
Somewhere, far off, the howl returns your name.
A worg’s silhouette lingers against the moonlight, impossibly still.
Frost gathers on its whiskers as it exhales a cloud of mist.
The forest seems smaller when it moves through the trees.
You hear the crunch of snow beneath deliberate paws.
Its eyes burn like coals, bright and unblinking.
The worg pauses, nostrils flaring as it tastes the air.
A soft rumble builds in its chest, the prelude to violence.
The beast’s fur shimmers faintly, touched by strange magic.
It lowers its head, muscles rippling beneath dark fur.
The worg circles a fallen log, never taking its eyes off you.
Its teeth catch the moonlight, silver and sharp.
You can feel its breath, heavy with hunger and memory.
The worg tilts its head, studying you like a puzzle.
A cold wind follows it wherever it walks.
The scent of iron and smoke clings to its fur.
It moves with the confidence of a killer who’s never missed.
A growl hums beneath its breath, constant, patient.
The worg’s ears twitch toward the faintest sound.
It vanishes behind a tree, reappearing somewhere closer.
The creature’s voice breaks the silence, rough as gravel.
You can tell it’s smiling, though you wish you couldn’t.
Its pawprints sink deeper than they should, like stone pressing into earth.
A faint shimmer traces its outline, something not entirely mortal.
The worg’s gaze pins you where you stand, and time slows.
It shakes its fur, sending sparks of frost into the air.
The night bends around it, thick with its presence.
A low, steady breath brushes your neck before it retreats.
It leaves behind nothing but silence and unease.
You know it’s still watching, even now.
Somewhere in the dark, the worg grins.
