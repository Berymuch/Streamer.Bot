A dragon circles overhead, scales shimmering like molten gold.
You feel the ground tremble, a dragon is near.
Smoke curls from ancient nostrils as the dragon wakes.
Wings unfold, blotting out the sun. The dragon sees you.
A low growl echoes in the dark, its patience wears thin.
The dragon’s eyes gleam with wisdom older than empires.
Heat ripples through the air as the dragon takes a breath.
Ash and embers drift where the dragon once stood.
A deep rumble rolls across the sky, that’s no thunder.
The dragon tilts its head, curious whether you’re prey or friend.
Molten light drips from the dragon’s scales as it stirs from slumber.
A flash of color streaks across the clouds, wings slicing the wind.
The scent of smoke and spice lingers in the dragon’s wake.
Ancient runes glow beneath its claws as it lands.
A shadow moves against the moon, scales catching the light.
You hear a heartbeat like a drum before the dragon speaks.
The dragon exhales softly, the world holding its breath.
A single golden eye opens, watching you without a word.
The air hums with magic as the dragon’s tail coils.
Dust swirls around its claws, the promise of power unspoken.
A deep voice vibrates through your chest, calm yet commanding.
The dragon’s wings stretch wide, scattering stars.
Its laughter crackles like fire, sharp and warm.
You spot the gleam of treasure beneath its curled form.
Steam hisses from its nostrils, tasting the air.
The dragon rests upon a mountain of forgotten crowns.
A storm gathers where its wings beat against the clouds.
The dragon lowers its head, smoke rising between its teeth.
A flick of its tail carves lines into the earth.
The dragon gazes into you, seeing more than you’d ever tell.
