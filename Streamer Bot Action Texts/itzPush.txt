off a cliff
into the void
into traffic
into the abyss
down the stairs
into orbit
into the sun
into a bush
through a window
into next week
off the map
into a dumpster
into space
into a volcano
into the sea
into a wall
into the clouds
off the stage
into a tree
down a well
into a lake
into the floor
off a bridge
into a pit
into the snow
into a pile of leaves
into another dimension
into the trash
into a portal
off the planet
onto a knot
into the fire
off of their chair
to the horde
off of their shelf
into their paws
off their throne
into the backrooms
into a washing mashine
into the shower
into the kettle
off of the plane
into the horny jail
into a goon cave
into a time loop
onto the bed
onto the kitchen counter
against a wall
using a leash
by their tail
